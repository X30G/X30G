## Donte' Simmons

I am a offensive security enthusiast focused on penetration testing, red teaming, tool developing, vulnerability and exploit researcher.
This github is a portfolio of my current skills and will update frequently with new skills and tools that I accumulate.
I do not have a coding background, so this is my proof of concept for my programming ability.

Currently learning programming languages Bash, Python, PowerShell, JavaScript, Node.js, Go, and Rust.
These languages were chosen because I want to build a solid programming foundation on modern languages to work more efficent and effective.

Each language serves a specific purpose:

* **Bash** – Automating Linux system tasks, scripting toolchains, downloading files, and modifying IP/network settings.
* **PowerShell** – Performing Windows user and system enumeration, executing payloads, automating post-exploitation, and changing network configurations.
* **Python** – Writing scripts for automation, creating reverse shells, parsing tool outputs (e.g., Nmap), integrating with APIs (Shodan, VirusTotal), and generating reports.
* **JavaScript** – Launching browser-based attacks (e.g., XSS, keyloggers), interacting with the DOM, and establishing client-side C2 channels.
* **Node.js** – Automating web application testing, fuzzing APIs, delivering payloads, and building lightweight backend services for tools or C2 servers.
* **Go** – Building fast, cross-platform enumeration tools, reverse shells, scanners, and stealthy binaries that can evade detection.
* **Rust** – Developing high-performance, memory-safe security tools, low-level network scanners, and custom payloads for exploitation.

Together these languages will give me the versatility to automate and execute every phase of the penetration testing lifecycle. From reconnaissance and exploitation, to reporting across both Linux and Windows environments.
