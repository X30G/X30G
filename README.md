## Donte' Simmons

I am a offensive security enthusiast focused on penetration testing, red teaming, tool developing, vulnerability and exploit researcher.
This github is a portfolio of my current skills and will update frequently with new skills and tools that I accumulate.
I do not have a coding background, so this is my proof of concept for my programming ability.
